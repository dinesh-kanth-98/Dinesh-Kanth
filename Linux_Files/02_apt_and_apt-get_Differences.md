In Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions, both `apt` and `apt-get` are package management tools used for installing, updating, and managing software packages. However, there are some differences in how they are used and their features:

1. *Simplicity and Usability:*
   - `apt` is designed to be more user-friendly and intuitive. It provides more user-friendly output and better handling of dependencies.
   - `apt-get` is the older tool and is considered to be less user-friendly, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line package management.

2. *Progress Indicator:*
   - `apt` includes a built-in progress indicator that shows the download progress when installing packages. This feature makes it more user-friendly.
   - `apt-get` does not have a built-in progress indicator, which means you might not see the download progress when using it.

3. *Commands:*
   - `apt` combines the functionality of several `apt-get` commands into a single, more versatile command. For example, instead of using `apt-get install`, you can use `apt install`.
   - `apt-get` has a separate command for each operation, such as `apt-get install`, `apt-get update`, `apt-get upgrade`, and so on.

4. *Automatic Handling of Dependencies:*
   - `apt` automatically resolves and installs package dependencies when you use the `apt install` command. This simplifies the installation process.
   - `apt-get` also resolves dependencies but may require you to use the `apt-get install -f` command separately if any dependency issues arise.

5. *Cache Management:*
   - Both `apt` and `apt-get` use the same package cache, so there's no difference in terms of package caching.

In summary, while both `apt` and `apt-get` can be used for package management, `apt` is generally preferred for its user-friendliness and streamlined command syntax. It's recommended to use `apt` for most package management tasks in Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions. However, `apt-get` is still available and can be used if you prefer or are more familiar with its syntax.
