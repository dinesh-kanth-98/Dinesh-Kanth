# Linux Man Pages brief

1. **manpages-dev**:
   - This package contains manual pages that describe the APIs available for C library functions. It is useful for developers who want to reference these pages when programming in C.
   - These manpages help developers understand how to use various C library functions, system calls, and other development-related topics.

2. **manpages-posix-dev**:
   - This package provides manual pages that describe the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standards for software development. It covers POSIX APIs and system calls.
   - It's essential for developers who work on POSIX-compliant systems and want to ensure their software conforms to the POSIX standard.

3. **man-db**:
   - `man-db` is the system utility responsible for displaying manual pages in the terminal. It manages the storage, indexing, and retrieval of manpages.
   - It ensures that manual pages are easily accessible to users via the `man` command. It's an essential component of the Linux manual system.

4. **manpages-posix**:
   - This package contains the actual POSIX standard documents. These documents define the POSIX standard and provide details about POSIX-compliant APIs and system calls.
   - These pages are useful for both developers and system administrators who want to understand and adhere to the POSIX standard.

5. **manpages**:
   - This is a meta-package that depends on a standard set of Linux manual pages. It ensures that you have access to basic and commonly used manpages for commands, functions, and system calls.
   - It's a convenient package for users and administrators who want a comprehensive set of manual pages.

> These packages and the `man-db` utility are integral to the Linux manual system, ensuring that users and developers have access to documentation and can view manual pages from the terminal using the `man` command. They contribute to a better understanding of Linux commands and system functionality.
