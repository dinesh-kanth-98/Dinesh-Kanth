You can download the latest version of `pip` (Python package manager) directly from the official Python Package Index (PyPI) website. Here are the steps to download `pip`:

1. **Go to the PyPI `pip` page:** Visit the PyPI page for `pip` using your web browser. The URL for the `pip` project on PyPI is:

   [https://pypi.org/project/pip/](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

2. **Download the `pip` package:** On the `pip` project page, you will see a section labeled "Project description." In this section, you'll find links to download the `pip` package in various formats, including `.tar.gz` and `.zip`. Typically, you'll want to download the `.tar.gz` package, as it's a common format for Python packages.

   Click on the link to download the `.tar.gz` package to your computer.

3. **Extract the `pip` package:** After downloading the `.tar.gz` package, you can extract it using a tool like `tar`. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the package. Then, run the following command to extract it:

   ```bash
   tar -xzvf pip-x.y.z.tar.gz
   ```

   Replace `pip-x.y.z.tar.gz` with the actual filename you downloaded, which should include the version number.

4. **Install `pip`:** Once the package is extracted, navigate to the extracted directory:

   ```bash
   cd pip-x.y.z
   ```

   Inside this directory, you'll find a script named `setup.py`. You can install `pip` using Python's `setuptools` by running:

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

   This will install the latest version of `pip` on your system.

5. **Verify `pip` installation:** After installation, you can verify that `pip` is installed and check its version by running:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

This process will download and install the latest version of `pip` on your system. Keep in mind that Python typically comes with `pip` pre-installed, so you may not need to download it separately unless you have specific requirements for a newer version.
