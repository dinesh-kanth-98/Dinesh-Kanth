    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text or a sequence of characters into smaller units called tokens. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), tokens are usually words or subwords, and this process is a fundamental step in various NLP tasks like text analysis, text classification, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word Tokenization:** This is the most common form of tokenization, where a text is split into individual words. For example, the sentence \"Tokenization is important\" would be tokenized into three tokens: \"Tokenization,\" \"is,\" and \"important.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentence Tokenization:** In some cases, you may want to tokenize text into sentences. This process involves splitting a text into its constituent sentences. For example, the paragraph \"This is sentence one. This is sentence two.\" would be tokenized into two tokens: \"This is sentence one.\" and \"This is sentence two.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subword Tokenization:** Subword tokenization is used when you want to break text down into smaller units, which can be especially useful for languages with complex word structures. Subword tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece are used in many modern NLP models."
