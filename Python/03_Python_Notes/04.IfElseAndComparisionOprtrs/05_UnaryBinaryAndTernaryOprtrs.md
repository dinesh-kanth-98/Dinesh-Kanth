**<div align="center">unary, binary, and ternary operators</div>**

**Unary Operators (1 Operand):**
Unary operators work with a single operand or value. They perform operations on that single input.

1. **Unary Negation (`-`)**: Changes the sign of a numeric value.
2. **Unary Plus (`+`)**: Explicitly indicates the positive sign of a numeric value, but it doesn't change the value itself.
3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: Negates the boolean value of its operand (changes `True` to `False` and vice versa).

**Binary Operators (2 Operands):**
Binary operators work with two operands or values. They perform operations that involve two inputs.

4. **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numeric values together.
5. **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second numeric value from the first.
6. **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numeric values.
7. **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first numeric value by the second.
8. **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder after dividing the first numeric value by the second.
9. **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises the first numeric value to the power of the second.
10. **Equality (`==`)**: Compares two values to check if they are equal.
11. **Inequality (`!=`)**: Compares two values to check if they are not equal.
12. **Greater Than (`>`)**: Compares two values to check if the first is greater than the second.
13. **Less Than (`<`)**: Compares two values to check if the first is less than the second.
14. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: Compares two values to check if the first is greater than or equal to the second.
15. **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: Compares two values to check if the first is less than or equal to the second.
16. **Logical AND (`and`)**: Returns `True` if both boolean values are `True`, otherwise `False`.
17. **Logical OR (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one boolean value is `True`, otherwise `False`.

**Ternary Operator (3 Operands):**
The ternary operator is a special operator that takes three operands. It allows you to create conditional expressions.

18. **Ternary Operator (`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`)**:
    - Checks a condition.
    - If the condition is `True`, it returns `value_if_true`.
    - If the condition is `False`, it returns `value_if_false`.

These operators are essential building blocks in programming, enabling you to perform a wide range of operations and make decisions based on conditions. Understanding how each type of operator works is crucial for effective programming.
