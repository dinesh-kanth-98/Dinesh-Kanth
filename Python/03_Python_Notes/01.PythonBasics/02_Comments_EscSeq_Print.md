# Python Comments

A comment is a part of the code that the programmer does not want to execute. It is used to explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of specific parts of the code while testing.

## Single-Line Comments

To write a single-line comment, add a `#` at the start of the line.

### Example 1
```python
# This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
print("This is a print statement.")
```

Output:
```
This is a print statement.
```

### Example 2
```python
print("Hello World !!!") # Printing Hello World
```

Output:
```
Hello World !!!
```

### Example 3
```python
print("Python Program")
# print("Python Program")
```

Output:
```
Python Program
```

## Multi-Line Comments

To write multi-line comments, you can use `#` at the start of each line, or you can use a multiline string.

### Example 1: Using `#`
```python
# It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
# If the condition is false, then it will execute another block of code.
p = 7
if p > 5:
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
```

Output:
```
p is greater than 5.
```

### Example 2: Using Multiline String
```python
"""This is an if-else statement.
It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
If the condition is false, then it will execute another block of code."""
p = 7
if p > 5:
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
```

Output:
```
p is greater than 5.
```

# Escape Sequence Characters

Escape sequence characters are used to insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string. They are represented by a backslash `\` followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```python
print("This doesn't "execute")
print("This will \"execute\"")
```

# Python Print Statement

The `print()` function in Python is used to display output to the console or standard output. It allows you to print strings, variables, and other data to the screen. The `print()` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python for debugging, displaying information to users, and other purposes.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `print()` function is as follows:

```python
print(object(s), sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

## Parameters

1. `objects`: One or more objects to be printed. These can be strings, variables, or expressions separated by commas.
2. `sep`: Specifies the separator between the objects. It is an optional parameter, and the default separator is a space `' '`.
3. `end`: Specifies the string to be printed at the end. It is an optional parameter, and the default value is a newline character `'\n'`.
4. `file`: Specifies the output stream where the data will be printed. It is an optional parameter, and the default value is `sys.stdout`, which represents the console.
5. `flush`: If `True`, the output is forcibly flushed to the `file` stream. It is an optional parameter, and the default value is `False`.

## Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate the usage of the `print()` function:

```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
print("Hello, World!")

# Example 2: Printing multiple objects
name = "John"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

# Example 3: Using a custom separator
print("apple", "orange", "banana", sep=', ')

# Example 4: Using a custom end string
print("Hello", end=' ')
print("World!")

# Example 5: Printing to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    print("This is written to a file.", file=f)

# Example 6: Flushing the output
import time
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=' ', flush=True)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Output

```
Hello, World!
Name: John Age: 30
apple, orange, banana
Hello World!
```

> `The `print()` function is versatile and provides various formatting options for displaying output in Python programs. It is a fundamental tool for communicating information to users and developers during the execution of a program.
