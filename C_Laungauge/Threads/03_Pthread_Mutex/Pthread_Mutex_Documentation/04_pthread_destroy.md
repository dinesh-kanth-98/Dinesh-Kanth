### Function Signature

```c
int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t* mutex);
```

### Parameters

- `mutex`: A pointer to the mutex object to be destroyed.

### Return Value

- If successful, `pthread_mutex_destroy` returns 0.

- If an error occurs during destruction, it returns a non-zero error code.

### Description

The `pthread_mutex_destroy` function is used to destroy a previously initialized mutex, releasing any associated resources and allowing it to be safely deallocated. Mutex destruction is an important step in proper resource management in multi-threaded programs.

### Mutex Destruction

- When a mutex is no longer needed or when your program is about to exit, you should destroy the mutex to prevent resource leaks.

- After destroying a mutex, it becomes invalid, and any attempt to use it, like locking or unlocking, will result in undefined behavior.

- If a mutex is destroyed while it is still locked by a thread, the behavior is undefined. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the mutex is unlocked by all threads before destroying it.

### Usage Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

int main() {
    pthread_mutex_t my_mutex;

    // Initialize the mutex
    if (pthread_mutex_init(&my_mutex, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_init");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use the mutex for synchronization in your program

    // Destroy the mutex when it's no longer needed
    if (pthread_mutex_destroy(&my_mutex) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_destroy");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We initialize a `pthread_mutex_t` variable `my_mutex` using `pthread_mutex_init`.

- The mutex is used for synchronization in the program (not shown in the example).

- When the mutex is no longer needed, we destroy it using `pthread_mutex_destroy` to release associated resources.

### Error Handling

- If `pthread_mutex_destroy` fails, it returns an error code that you can check to handle destruction errors.

- Common error codes include `EBUSY` (the mutex is still locked by a thread) and others, depending on the implementation.

- Always check the return value of `pthread_mutex_destroy` and handle errors appropriately in your code.

### Important Notes

- Mutex destruction is an essential step in preventing resource leaks and ensuring proper resource management in multi-threaded programs.

- You should destroy a mutex only when you are certain that it is no longer needed and that it has been unlocked by all threads that have used it.

- Destroying a mutex renders it invalid, and further attempts to use it will result in undefined behavior.

- Proper synchronization and resource management are crucial to avoid synchronization issues like race conditions and deadlocks in multi-threaded programs.
